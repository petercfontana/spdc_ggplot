# spdc_ggplot

This github repository contains my presentation materials for my ggplot presentation at Statistical Programming DC (see https://nvite.com/DataDC/c2c4 for the talk announcement).

There are three different materials:

1. The slides (.pdf) used at the beginning of the presentation.
2. The complete jupyter notebook (.ipynb) that uses an R kernel and contains the code and the plots.
3. An .html export of the jupyter notebook. Since juypter notebooks look change based on each individual's custom.css and custom.js files for the notebook, I have provided an .html file that looks how it looked during the presentation.
